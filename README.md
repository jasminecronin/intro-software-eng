# Introduction to Software Engineering

Coursework done for the University of Calgary. Assignments involved a variety of software development practices, such as requirements gathering, developing use cases, UML and sequence diagrams, and code inspection.

## Group Project

This course involved developing a software application in a group of 6. Our application was a fictional Scholarship Application system for students of the University of Calgary to use to view and apply for a variety of awards. Admin users could make edits to the awards database and select scholarship winners, who would then be notified through the system.
